# Dev-tools
This contains a couple of tools useful for development.
To run this don't forget to allow for the script to be runnable.
You can do this via
```
chmod +x dev_tools/script.sh
dev_tools/script.sh
```

Or by running it directly

```
bash dev_tools/script.sh
```
All scripts should be run from the root of the project.
